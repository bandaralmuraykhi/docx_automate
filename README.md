## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/??????????????
   ```

2. Backend Setup:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python3 -m venv .flask-env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```
       .flask-env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For macOS and Linux:
       ```
       source .flask-env/bin/activate
       ```
      - Install the backend dependencies:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Open your terminal or command prompt application.

2. **Download Node.js Installer**: You can download the Node.js installer from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3. **Install Node.js**: Depending on your operating system, the installation steps may vary:

   - **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded installer (.msi file) and follow the installation wizard instructions. Make sure to select the option to include npm during installation.
   
   - **macOS**: You can install Node.js using Homebrew by running the following command in Terminal:
     ```
     brew install node
     ```
   
   - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: You can install Node.js using apt by running the following commands in Terminal:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```

   - **Linux (Fedora)**: You can install Node.js using dnf by running the following command in Terminal:
     ```
     sudo dnf install nodejs npm
     ```

  - install bluma
  ```
  npm install bulma
  ```

### Using Environment Variable:
### On Windows:

1. **Using Command Prompt:**
   - Open Command Prompt.
   - Set the environment variable using the `set` command:
     ```cmd
     set FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
     ```

### On macOS/Linux:

1. **Using Terminal:**
   - Open your Terminal.
   - Use the `export` command to set the environment variable:
     ```bash
     export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
     ```

there are a few additional features and improvements we could consider adding to enhance the user experience and functionality of the application:

1. Progress Indicator: Add a progress indicator or loading spinner to provide visual feedback to the user while the file is being uploaded, processed, or downloaded. This can be especially useful for larger files or slower network connections.

2. File Management: Implement a file management system where uploaded files are stored securely on the server and can be accessed or deleted by authorized users. This would require additional backend storage and database integration.

# ##########

- Form Response Management:
Create a dashboard or admin panel where form creators can view and manage the form responses.
Display a list of form submissions, allow downloading the filled documents, and provide options to delete or archive responses.

- Error Handling and Validation:
Implement proper error handling and display meaningful error messages to the user when something goes wrong, such as file upload failures, invalid form submissions, or server errors.
Add client-side and server-side validation for form inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid or malicious input.

- Form Submission Notifications:
Implement email notifications to the form creator when someone submits the form.
This will keep the form creator informed about the form submissions and allow them to take necessary actions.


- Error Handling: Improve error handling with custom error pages for common HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.).

- Validation and Sanitization: Further enhance the validation of user inputs, especially for file uploads and form submissions, to prevent attacks like SQL injection or XSS.

- Environment Variables for Configuration: Use environment variables for configuration settings like SECRET_KEY, database URI, etc., instead of hardcoding them in the script.

- User Roles and Permissions: Introduce roles (admin, regular user, etc.) and permissions for different levels of access control.

- Dockerization: Containerize the app with Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
